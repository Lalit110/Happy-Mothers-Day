            <p>Mother, Mamma, Mommy or just plain Mom are just some names for the woman in your life that will help raise you and love you unconditionally forever and always. A mother endures the good, the bad and the ugly from their children and always hands out hugs and kisses. They are the rock and the support throughout the good and bad times in your life. A mommy will always hold you near and dear while wiping away your tears. A Mamma will kiss your owies and make you smile. A mother will try and take all your pain and sorrow away and make them hers. But what is it really like to be a mother? I mean really truly, open your feelings and mind and state the truth? Is it all roses and sunshine? Is it ok not be crafty or to lose your patience? Do you have to volunteer at the school every month or can you just lounge at home and eat Oreos and drink milk on the couch during the school Halloween party? So I am here to tell you the truth about being a mom and while I am at it, what is a true mom?

First off, a mom can come in all shapes and sizes and even genders. I say this because the list of mom’s is never ending. There is the biological mother, the foster mother, the step-mother, the single mother, the single father, the grandparent, and so much more. 

A mother is a caregiver and unconditional love giver, housekeeper, cooker, baker, taxi driver, psychologist, doctor and discipliner. They are the ones who bear the burden of everything good and bad as the days grow on. They are the ones who might get left behind; as they do so much they don’t get as much appreciation. </p>
